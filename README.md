# BlueHat-Operative-System
"OS" I've been making for fun (not really an operating system)
(comments added via chatgpt and deepseek)

TODO:
- Change Name from EG-Term to BlueHat-OS
- Change project file structure
- proper filesystem
- add binary file support
- add runbin command
- add general useful commands
- implement syscalls and interrupts
